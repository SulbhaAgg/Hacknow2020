# eduSpace
A unique classroom platform with an emphasis on community and peer to peer collaboration.

## Inspiration: 
Students in the classroom are not able to connect with professors as before, or sometimes they are hesitant to reach out. So we created a full featured platform to combine time-tracking, communication, collaboration, planner and analyzing tools all in one place so students and professors do not need to spend extra time or money for other platforms.

## What it does
<ul>
<li>A web based platform which is divided into two sides for teachers and students with different functionalities.</li>
<ul>Student Side: 
<li>Dashboard has overall statistics, that includes total assignments, and number of completed assignments.<br>
In Addition, it shows most recent threads from the class chatbox and reminders for due assignments.</li>
<li>By clicking on Assigned and Grades from the side bar, students can check all previous assignments, new assignments and their grades.</li>
<li>There additional feature of peer to peer on student side navbar, where they can connect with all their classmates and classmates who have volunteered to help will have a green connect button and have appear in very first row.</li>
<li>Students can join the classroom by clicking on join Button on left, and classroom only opens up during class scheduled time or professor virtual hours</li>
</ul>
<ul>Professor Side: 
<li>Dashboard has overall class performance in graph and pie chart format, and it all automated. <br>
In addition, it will show that which students have performed well in recent exam, which will help Prof to connect those students with other students who might need more help.</li>
<li>In Addition, Professors can easily add new assignments and give grades by clicking on Assign and Grade tab on left side bar.</li>
<li>To start the lecture or office hours virtually prof can just click on Start session button on the left side bar.</li>
<li>In addition Professor can add or delete students from classroom, for example someone dropped the class</li></ul>
</ul>

## How I built it
<ul>
<li>React.js: React helps to connect front with blackened, makes it user to use API as many of them are in JavaScript and some of them can only work with React.</li>
<li>HTML5, CSS: First I build the whole front-end in HTML, CSS and then changed it to react syntax as this was my very first time coding with React</li>
<li>JavaScript: For validation, and making quizzes</li>
<li>chart.js: For making very beautiful, real time rendering graphs :)</li>
<li>Agora API: For online virtual streaming platform</li> 
<li>MangoDB: For all the data storage as database and authentication for login and registration page</li>
<li>Python: For back-end</li>
<li>Google Cloud: Used app engine to host our web server and front-end too</li>
</ul>

## Challenges I ran into
<ul>
<li>Getting Agora video streaming to work was the biggest channel we faced.</li>
<li>And learning react for first time, and dealing with those erros</li>
</ul>

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
So glad that we are able to build an very gorgeous user friendly platform for students to interact with the peers and professors. 

## What I learned
<ul>
<li>How to use Agora API.</li>
<li>How easy it to just chart.js and do real time rendering.</li>
<li>And obviously React</li>
</ul>

## What's next for eduSpace
<ul>
<li>We want to take our platform to next level and by adding functioning of holding virtual call with prof for more than 17 students.</li>
<li>People use Facebook, whatsapp because of how beautiful and friendly their interface is, schools' use blackboard or canvas, which definetly is not pretty and a lot of time it's under construction. What if students get the same kind of platform but for education. Education becomes fun.</li>
<li>I am definitely going  to work on this project further and convert it into a start up</li>
</ul>
